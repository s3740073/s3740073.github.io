    <div class="body1">
    &emsp;I have grown up hand on keyboard, living with computers since a very young age.  My earliest memory on using computers for other than games was programming a simple quiz in Basic on my father's old MS-DOS computer.  
    <br>&emsp;Over the years, I have dabbled in many IT projects, from visual basic games to a javascript course in secondary school.  
    <br>&emsp;Attending this course at RMIT, I seek to improve my foundations in programming and IT skills as most of my current knowledge is self-taught.

    <br>&emsp;My ideal job would be a software engineer developing critical software to analyse data on a large scale.  In particular, machine learning problems have recently seen great advances and are a hot field of explorations to be tapped.  
    <br>&emsp;The position requires strong programming skills, working with cloud technologies and machine learning skills.  
    <br>&emsp;While I have some experience with programming, cloud technologies and machine learning are new fields.  
    <br>&emsp;At some point, I intend to take further courses to learn the common technologies used to work with cloud applications but machine learning looks like I will need to self-learn.

    <div class="body1">
    &emsp;<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality">MBTI</a>
    <br>&emsp;I have an INTP type personality according to MBTI tests, this has been roughly stable since I was young though I have picked up more awareness towards emotional development as I grew older.  Nowhere close to changing to an F type however.  
    <br>&emsp;<a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/">Learning Style</a>
    <br>&emsp;I divide my learning evenly between visual and written modes, preferring diagrams and documents explaining the subject matter.  However, I also learn best when, after provided the basic information, I am given the freedom to explore the system on my own and apply it to examples.  The process of relating 'dead' information to 'living' uses most accurately describes how I learn.  
    <br>&emsp;<a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/">Big Five Personality</a>
    <br>&emsp;I score low on extroversion and agreeableness, being less likely to relate to strangers and find social situations draining.  I score high on emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination, being willing to entertain ideas, paying attention to details and being hard to move emotionally.  
    <br>
    <br>&emsp;Based on my experience in working with teams, I tend to work best as a follower to a stronger leader, though I have led small teams successfully when given clear objectives.  I prefer to suggest and discuss ideas with leadership that I think should be taken, though am still willing to go along with less than personally-ideal arrangements.

    <div class="heading2">Scaling Vertical-Scrolling Shooter
    </div>
    <div class="body1">
    &emsp;<strong>Overview:</strong> I have an idea regarding a vertical scrolling shooting gmae ala DonPachi or Raiden, where the player controls an avatar on a screen to shoot and destroy enemies while avoiding being hit.  The key difference I intended was to slowly increase the scale of the game over time, with character progression as well as expanding the field of view by increasing zoom to accomodate increasing range and abilities as the game progresses.  
    <br>&emsp;<strong>Motivation:</strong> I have always wondered if RPG-like progression with scaling characters could be combined successfully with the vertical-scroller genre as I have not seen such done before.  The two genres often do not marry well together as increasing complexity and abilities of character progression does not represent well on a more visual game like a vertical-scoller.  However, I believe that by manipulating the zoom (and possibly the physics time-factor), this can be achieved.  
    <br>&emsp;<strong>Description:</strong> A vertical scroller shooting game involves the player controlling an avatar (usually a sprite) that moves over a 2D visual field.  Enemies appear on the field that present threats the player will have to avoid or destroy with the avatar's weapons.  Keyboard controls the avatar's movements as well as menu selections.  
    <br>&emsp;Each "stage" corresponds to a scripted (or generated) series of enemies and obstacles, at the end of each "stage", the player is provided with advancement and game options before continuing on to the next.  
    <br>&emsp;The primary innovation involved a time and space zoom function.  Key controls to zoom out or in around the avatar changes the field of view, time controls to speed up or slow down the simulation tick rate; these functions are limited by character progression.  
    <br>&emsp;<strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong> While undecided, I believe this can be developed on Unity, although I haven't worked with the platform before.  
    <br>&emsp;<strong>Skills:</strong> Programming skills and familiarity with Unity will be required at a minimum for this project.  
    <br>&emsp;<strong>Outcome:</strong> A successful development should result in the framework with a proof of concept of each of the features described.
