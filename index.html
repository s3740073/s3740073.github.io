    <div class="body1">
    &emsp;I have grown up hand on keyboard, living with computers since a very young age.  My earliest memory on using computers for other than games was programming a simple quiz in Basic on my father's old MS-DOS computer.  
    <br>&emsp;Over the years, I have dabbled in many IT projects, from visual basic games to a javascript course in secondary school.  
    <br>&emsp;Attending this course at RMIT, I seek to improve my foundations in programming and IT skills as most of my current knowledge is self-taught.

    <br>&emsp;My ideal job would be a software engineer developing critical software to analyse data on a large scale.  In particular, machine learning problems have recently seen great advances and are a hot field of explorations to be tapped.  
    <br>&emsp;The position requires strong programming skills, working with cloud technologies and machine learning skills.  
    <br>&emsp;While I have some experience with programming, cloud technologies and machine learning are new fields.  
    <br>&emsp;At some point, I intend to take further courses to learn the common technologies used to work with cloud applications but machine learning looks like I will need to self-learn.

    <div class="heading1">Personal Profile
    </div>
    <div class="body1">
    &emsp;<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality">MBTI</a>
    <br>&emsp;I have an INTP type personality according to MBTI tests, this has been roughly stable since I was young though I have picked up more awareness towards emotional development as I grew older.  Nowhere close to changing to an F type however.  
    <br>&emsp;<a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/">Learning Style</a>
    <br>&emsp;I divide my learning evenly between visual and written modes, preferring diagrams and documents explaining the subject matter.  However, I also learn best when, after provided the basic information, I am given the freedom to explore the system on my own and apply it to examples.  The process of relating 'dead' information to 'living' uses most accurately describes how I learn.  
    <br>&emsp;<a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/">Big Five Personality</a>
    <br>&emsp;I score low on extroversion and agreeableness, being less likely to relate to strangers and find social situations draining.  I score high on emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination, being willing to entertain ideas, paying attention to details and being hard to move emotionally.  
    <br>
    <br>&emsp;Based on my experience in working with teams, I tend to work best as a follower to a stronger leader, though I have led small teams successfully when given clear objectives.  I prefer to suggest and discuss ideas with leadership that I think should be taken, though am still willing to go along with less than personally-ideal arrangements.
